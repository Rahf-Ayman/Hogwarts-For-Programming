# Hogwarts for Programming ðŸª„ðŸ”®

A web-based platform inspired by the magical world of Hogwarts, designed to teach programming through interactive courses, quizzes, and challenges. Users can enroll in courses, solve quizzes, and track their progress on leaderboards.

This project was completed in collaboration with [Rahf](https://github.com/Rahf-Ayman) and [Badr](https://github.com/TrueBadr) as part of the IEEE ZSB Backend track.
